IDEAS:


Go from global to local:
    - heres a summary for you specifically
    - be able to look up any place in the world
    - look up events and issues that may be local, connect localities based on common problem or solution?

    - ie map the top concepts that have articles with high average sentiment as 'things going well' and vice versa
    - Could we map to geographies or countries?
